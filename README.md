# Phase-1-Project
#  WakiliLink ‚Äî Legal Help Triage & Referrals

**WakiliLink** is a single-page web application that helps citizens in Kenya find the right kind of legal help quickly.  
It uses a simple triage wizard to identify the nature and urgency of a user‚Äôs legal issue, checks basic eligibility for legal aid, and suggests nearby legal-aid centres or lawyers.  
The app also links to relevant resources from [Kenya Law](https://kenyalaw.org) and uses the **Nominatim (OpenStreetMap)** API to locate and rank providers by proximity.

##  Project Overview

- **Goal:** Build a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that integrates at least one public API and demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous data fetching.  
- **Frameworks:** None ‚Äî the project is fully front-end and runs in the browser without reloads.  
- **APIs Used:**
  - **Nominatim (OpenStreetMap):** Provides geocoding and reverse-geocoding to determine location proximity.
  - **Kenya Law:** Linked for legal information and case references (no API key required).

##  Features (MVP)

1. **Legal Issue Triage Wizard**  
   Users answer a few guided questions to classify their issue (employment, family, property, criminal, etc.).

2. **Urgency & Legal-Aid Eligibility Engine**  
   A simple rule-based logic calculates urgency and determines if the user might qualify for free or low-cost legal services.

3. **Provider Search & Matching System**  
   Displays a list of providers filtered by county, cost band, and area of practice.  
   If location is provided, Nominatim ranks providers by proximity.

4. **Action Cards & Legal Resources**  
   Generates quick next-step cards (e.g., ‚ÄúDocument the facts‚Äù, ‚ÄúSeek help within 48 hours‚Äù) and links to relevant Kenya Law pages.

5. **Printable Demand-Letter Template**  
   Automatically fills a template with user input for printing or saving as PDF.

6. **Local Storage Persistence**  
   Saves triage results locally so users can return without re-entering data.

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Option 1 ‚Äî Run as a Static SPA
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Everything runs locally ‚Äî no setup required.

How It Works

User fills the triage form.

The app scores urgency, fetches coordinates from Nominatim, and filters matching providers.

Results display dynamically on the same page ‚Äî no reloads.

The user can print or save their generated letter and revisit later (saved in localStorage).

Testing & Debugging

All API requests use fetch() with error handling.

console.log() statements left in non-critical parts for debugging.

Works on modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

UI & Theming

Built with responsive CSS grid.

Supports dark / light theme toggle.

Styled using modern CSS variables, gradients, and soft shadows.
